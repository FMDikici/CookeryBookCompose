# 🍽️ Jetpack Compose Food Recipes App

This project is a modern reimplementation of a food recipe app I had previously built using XML layouts. As part of my journey to master **Jetpack Compose**, I recreated the entire UI using Compose's declarative and powerful toolkit.

🚀 **Why I built this again?**

I wanted to challenge myself by transforming an old-school XML-based project into a sleek and reactive Compose version. This allowed me to:

- Embrace modern Android development practices
- Improve UI/UX consistency
- Sharpen my skills in **navigation**, **state management**, and **composable functions**

💡 **What you’ll find in this app:**

- A clean food list screen using `LazyColumn`
- A detailed screen with food images, ingredients, and styled texts
- Smooth navigation with arguments using `NavController`
- Thematic styling with `Material3` support
